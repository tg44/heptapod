# heptapod

This is a command line application to manage and fine-tune
[Time Machine](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) exclude paths.

<details>
  <summary>Why it is named after creatures from Arrival?</summary>
Heptapods are extraterrestrial species from the movie Arrival.
They are special because they have non-linear time perspective.
Their written language (Heptapod B) is basically describes 
the future and the past in the same time. Hence the name of the tool.

### Install

```sh
brew tap tg44/heptapod
```
```sh
brew install heptapod
```

### Usage

To print help;
```
heptapod -h
heptapod <action> -h
```

Move (and use) the default ruleset;
```
mkdir -p ~/.heptapod/rules
cp -R $(brew --prefix heptapod)/rules ~/.heptapod
```

Lists all the rules (you get 4 tables, enabled, disabled, parseable but unrunable and unparsable).
```
heptapod rules ls -a
```

Enable/disable rules (by name), or add/remove ignore folders;
```
heptapod rules disable node bower
heptapod rules enable bower
heptapod rules ignoreAdd ~/.Trash ~/.yarn/cache ~/Library
heptapod rules ignoreRemove ~/.Trash
```

List all the currently excluded TM paths;
```
heptapod tm ls
```

Dryrun the current rules, in verbose mode, also log speed and debug informations. (Potentially list nonexistent directories and files!)
```
heptapod -v 1 run -d
```

To run the current rules, and add the dirs to the TM exclude list. Also writes exclude logs to `~/.heptapod/logs` (or the given `--logDir dir`) for easier revert.
```
heptapod run
```

To revert all the previously added paths from the run-exclude-logs. (`prune -h` could tell you the other useful revert options).
```
heptapod prune -a
```

### Dictionary
 - **path** - a file or a folder
 - **search path** - a path that we want to process
 - **ignore path** - path that we don't process (further)
 - **exclude path** - path that we don't want in our TM saves
 - **include path** - path that we want in our TM saves
 - **ignore rule** - a rule that parse git/docker ignore file format

### Notes from TM migrating to a new machine
When you try to migrate your TM state to a new machine
`xcode-select --install` may be needed. Somehow this is 
sometimes not migrated as you thought it would be.

### Notes from TM in general
There are two ways to exclude a dir from backups;
- exclude by path (`tmutil addexclusion -p`)
  - needs sudo
  - can be read back with `defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist SkipPaths`
  - appears in TM preferences / options
- exclude by flag (`tmutil addexclusion`)
  - keeps the given flag when moved
  - can not be reliably list them (`mdfind com_apple_backup_excludeItem = 'com.apple.backupd'` is a close call, but some folders are excluded by mdfind too)

This tool excludes by flag! You can check any folder manually with `tmutil isexcluded`. **If you delete a folder, it will be deleted with its flag. You don't need to clean up ever.**
Also, you can only exclude nonexcluded files with tmutil, so we only add them if they are exists and if they are not already added.

### Rules
Every rule has a searchPaths, ignorePaths.
 - `name` for categorization
 - `enabled` for easier enable/disable
 - `searchPaths` are the root of the rule search like `~`
 - `ignorePaths` are subpaths that we want to ignore to make the run quicker
   - like we want to parse dirs under `~`, but not `~/Downloads`
 - `type` is the ruletype
   - `file-trigger`
   - `regexp`
   - `ignore-file`
   - `global`
   - `list`
 - `settings` other type setting see below

#### Ignore file (not yet implemented)
Parses the `.gitignore` or `.dockerignore` files, and excludes its contents.
 - `forceIncludePaths` are files that we add even if they would be otherwise excluded
   - like `.gitignore` ignores `.env` files but we forcefully want to add them back 
 - `fileName`
   - `.gitignore` or `.dockerignore`
 - devdocs:
   - the problem with this, that you need to go into the whole subtree to do the parsings

#### Regexp (not yet implemented)
Ignores all files/folders with the given regexp. This can be slow!
 - `regexp`

#### File trigger
Ignores files/dirs based on other files existence, made for easy language dep ignores.
 - `fileTrigger` like `package.json` or `.git`
 - `excludePaths` like `node-modules` or `.`

#### Global
Globally ignores or excludes path (overrides other rules walk ignores).
 - `path` the global path we want to evaluate (like `~/.npm`)
 - `handleWith` a string enum
    - `ignore` - ignores globally
    - `exclude` - ignores globally and excludes from backups
    - any other value - do nothing

#### List
Can group multiple rules to a single file.
 - `subRules` the array of subRules (can be recursive with another `list`)

Notes;
 - while `rules ls` works, `enable`, `disable` and the path commands not working for the subrules, you need to edit the file manually
 - if the list is disabled, all of it subs are handled as disables
 - the group `searchPaths` and `ignorePaths` are currently do nothing
   - probably this will change for easier customisations

### Contribution
If you are interested in this repo, star it, and write an issue, and we can talk about future ideas there!


### Repo/developement state
done:
- architecture the protocol/configs
- most of asimov's features are ported
- example rules added
- command line interface
- option to dryrun, show inner states, write to file
- purge option
   - we should write down what paths excluded by us, and include them back
- brew package
- ghactions
- rule manage commands (list/enable/disable/ignoreAdd/ignoreRemove)
- global rule type
- list rule type (for better rule grouping)

todos:
- reorganise rules
- fix the rule manage commands for lists
- support tmignore functionality
- support tmignore like funcionality with dockerignore
- regexp pattern
- hook to rerun periodically/before tmbackups
- port asimov's issues (spotify, spotlight)
- docker support (at least tell if docker vm is persisted or not)
   - this is kinda easy with tmutil.GetExcludeList()
- android vms?
   - this should be also easy
- preemptive search that tells you how many files with which size will be excluded/included
   - nice to have, we can tell the sizes, but counting files need to actually count the files which could be slow AH
- speedtest it
- modify the backup intervals and frequencies
   - not sure it can be done with tmutil, but there are applications for this
- probably adding `.` and `..` will break the execution shortcuts and need to fix them
- wildcards like `*.sh` not working right now, do we want to make them work?
